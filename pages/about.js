            I am a recent Computer system graduate from CPUT, with a full yearsâ€™
            worth of industry work experience. This time was spent developing,
            testing and deploying code to perform required task. I am
            experienced in using the systems development life cycle (SDLC)
            method when working on new projects and maintaining or integrating
            into existing ones. I enjoy working on teams and am not afraid to
            take initiative in order to learn new things to accomplish what is
            required and may be required. I am currently finishing a Full Stack
            Web Development coarse HyperionDev, it has been challenging and
            rewarding but I can't wait to apply my newly gained knowlegde.
